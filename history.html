                        <h4>For hundreds of generations,</h4>
                        <p>the Ktunaxa used the Elk Valley and the Crowsnest Pass as a trade and travel route through the Rocky Mountains. Long before Provincial boundaries were laid out, twice-yearly Bison hunts were coordinated on the prairies east of the Rockies until the bison population was decimated in the mid-1800s.</p>
                        <p>The Elk Valley area was the primary home of the easternmost branch of the Ktunaxa people, who are closely connected to families living in the area now known as Tobacco Plains which straddles the US border to the southwest of Fernie. The Michel Prairie people, after whom the town of Michel was named, used the area near Sparwood to plant tobacco. Their Ktunaxa name is 'k?aqawakanmituqnik' and means "river running into and out again" (the Michel Creek into the Elk River).</p>
                        <p>Despite being subjected to 120 years of living on Indian Reserves, and decades of forced attendance at a Residential School at the St. Eugene Mission near Cranbrook, the Ktunaxa Nation continues to be a strong and thriving community. Today, there are more than 1,500 members in the BC communities of ?akisq?nuk, ?aq?am,?akink?um?asnuq?i?it, and yaqan nu?kiy. There are two Bands in Idaho and Montana connected by language and culture but politically independent.</p>
                        <p>Visitors to the region can learn more about the Ktunaxa by visiting the St. Eugene Mission Interpretive Centre and the Fernie Museum. A pull-out near Michel Creek at the former townsite of Michel offers visitors further information about the Michel Plains people.</p>

                        <h4>The Lower Kootenay Tribe,</h4>
                        <p>known as the Yaqan Nukiy is part of the Ktunaxa Nation. The Ktunaxa Nation consists of six different Bands, four located in British Columbia and two in the United States. The four bands located in British Columbia are referred to as bands, while the two bands in the United States are referred to as tribes. The Band name Yaqan Nukiy directly translates to "where the rock stands".</p>
                        <p>The land that belongs to the Ktunaxa Nation encompasses all of the south-eastern part of British Columbia along the Kootenay River also known as the Creston Valley. The land itself is 27,000 square miles, and that included some states in the United States. The near proximity to the Kootenay river not only provides their name, but also differentiates them from the Upper Kootenay band which consists of forest and mountains than rivers and lakes.</p>
